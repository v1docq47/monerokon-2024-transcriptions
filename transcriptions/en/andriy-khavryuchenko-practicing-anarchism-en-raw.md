_**Andriy:**_ My name is Andriy, Andriy Khavr. I'm also known as a practicing anarchist, and I'm known as Toxic Ancup. More importantly, I am Ukrainian who survived Chernobyl explosion, survived the crash of the Soviet Union, was on Maidan 2004, Maidan 2014, evacuated... one third of this company in 2014 from Russian invasion, has my house nearly bombed in 2022. And lately, practically speaking, I was denied entering my country and passed perennial by Ukrainian government. So you can guess I love the state. That's why I'm practicing anarchist.

Let's start with definitions. Practicing on Merriam-Webster is a person who is actively engaged in specified career or a way of life. An anarchist - a person who rebels against authority, established order, or ruling power. Let's do it up in it so from the very beginning.

In 17th century, philosopher Locke introduced a very bizarre concept that people can actually live by valuing freedom, life, and property more than any rules from above or God's will. US founding fathers changed this to the pursuit of freedom, life, and happiness, but who to criticize founding fathers?

Second important point - we live in a state of anarchy most of the time. Nobody forced us to come here and sit, whatever I'm talking about. Actual enforcement, state enforcement, is happening very rarely.

Yet, even in our world, conflicts are happening and they will happen. Therefore, while practicing anarchy, we have to learn to resolve them. There are just two ways, two principal ways to resolve any conflict. The peaceful resolutions, when conflicted parties are actually seeking a solution. They want to minimize loss to their property, even to the disputed property. And military one. When somebody values this property more than their life or freedom. Peaceful resolution doesn't preclude the use of kinetic means. Military resolution, military way doesn't require the difference in values.

So, what are the means of peaceful resolution of any conflict? If you and me have a conflict, we can go to an arbitrage and get advice how to resolve it. If we are not satisfied with this advice, we can go to a court and submit a full collateral for the properties that we have a conflict about. If not, we can start kinetic. And in this case, kinetic action stops exactly at the point when at least one of us re-values the value of the property under the conflict.

Means of military resolutions. Sorry, none, because it's war. And the only two ways out of war are peace, when one of sides returns to rational estimate of profit of losses, or genocide, when one of the sides stops being an organized entity.

What's the goal of the state? This is the means, and the goal of the state is taxation and taxation is theft. And as many of you know, state officials, office, behave as religiously motivated people. They believe that by using magic called "elections" and "I have an order", they have a claim on your property. Therefore, by this framework, they are not rational. This means the state kills. And there is no way out of this within the rules of the state. And this ends only when office will kill all productive people like we are here in the room. State is a parasite. Example: Soviet Union, Rouge Khmer, Cambodia, Northern Korea.

If I am a practicing anarchist, how would I deal with such people? Rational strategies are: evade. If I fail to evade the conflict, I would try to de-escalate, because actual conflict, kinetic conflict, is extremely expensive and I have very limited resources while state has a lot of them. Unfortunately, since state office are religiously motivated and their natural selections work to promote the most unrational and tyrannical people, most of them will believe that my attempts to de-escalate are the sign of weakness. Therefore, the third step, I would show that I'm ready for violence. And if the one in conflict is unescapable, I will use right away all the force to destroy my opponent. Because otherwise, I will be in the prolonged conflict, and this will cost me a lot. Useful metaphor for dealing with such crowds of people is to consider them a force of nature. You don't argue with hurricane. You or go out of his way or build a shelter.

So, state people behave like a destructive religious cult. Stop financing them. When you pay your taxes, you just give them more power. To do this, maximize your internal production. Do whatever you can do by yourself, within your family, within your community. Maximize agoric trade. And remember, the one-end conflict is inevitable, because office make themselves less rich while you grow your capital. They will come for you.

To evade build your mobility strategically. Prepare for physical mobility. I mean, not just cars, planes, whatever. Prepare IDs, visas, residence permits, passports, whatever you can. Choose your lifestyle location carefully. So you will have at least two ways to leave your home. Build your business online, so it would be extremely mobile. Use, minimize use of state currencies, or if you can, don't use them at all. And store your wealth in crypto. Diversify your income sources and resist KYC. Participate in economic insurgence.

Let me give one definition. Capital is a good, economic good, that is intended to produce other goods, not for immediate consumption. When my kid plays on this phone, this is just a basic economic good. When I'm doing business on my phone, this is capital. So save your capital outside of state reach. Grow your capital. Invest your capital to lower the future cost of the inevitable conflict with the state office. Grow your safety capital, the ones that you will spend when the conflict will start. Use your knowledge of technology as a leverage. Remember, this conflict will be conducted over several domains. Physical, when they will try to put physical force on you. Financial, when they will limit use of your funds. Economical, when they will regulate your businessâ€¦ out of business. And information, when they will bombard you with spam adverse and convince your neighbors that you are an evil person because you are boiling the oceans.

Starve for technological self-resistance, self-reliance. Grow your technology capital as a part of your safety capital so you will be able to machine anything you will need. Build your knowledge, analyze it. Build your production capabilities whatever you can. Make them small, make them mobile. Make them minimally attended. So you won't be obliged to run it day to day. Make this production capabilities full tolerant. Standardize the equipment.

Most important question, this is all fancy bells and whistles, but who pays for the party? You may know that there are two ways to coordinate groups of people. Hard coordination, which is power and order, and soft coordination by prices.

The whole economy, our productive capacity is built by soft coordination. Use this power. Discover the trading of risks, insurances, prices. Develop and use prediction markets. This is not developed yet as a software. Package them as a structured instrument, financial instruments and sell them not just to yourself, but to your neighbors, like an insurance.

But the conflict is inevitable. In the 60s, there was a US colonel from Air Force who tried to formalize why US fighter pilots frequently win combat with Soviet pilots. He created OODA loop. Observe. orient, decide and act. Utilize this framework to plan your behavior, your preparation for the inevitable conflict.

Plan before shit hits the fan.

If you are forced to defend your household. In every domain, once again, physical, financial, informational, observe your situational awareness. Orient your operational environments. Plan layered engagement. How you will retreat, because you can't sustain the prolonged conflict and take action. Remember that everything that can fail will fail. Prepare and drill in peacetime while you have time. This will be a critically important part of your safety capital. And of course, automate as much as possible.

If you are caught on the run, on the go, I have just two rules. Sorry, you're screwed. Rule number two, see rule number one.

Basic process is the same. Stay low profile. If you have a contact with your opponents, police, army, whatever, break it as soon as possible. If you can't break the contact, decide, fight, wield, and be extremely flexible. Whoever runs the OODA loop faster, this person wins.

And are there any lawyers here? Okay. Because I'm frequently asked this question. The rights that are granted to you by laws, by constitution, they are not rights, they are privileges. And whoever gives you those privileges, he can take them away from you. Real rights are not given, are not granted, they are taken, and you own them. And the real laws, the common law system, is just a network of agreements, peer-to-peer or cooperative agreements between people, actual people who suffer the cost of conflict, to minimize the potential cost of the future conflict.

So here is my call to action. Grow your safety and technology capital now. Remember that as in every capital market, liquidity is king. If you have right now an armed mob attacking you and you have one million dollars, it won't buy you handgun. But yesterday, you spent less than 1 % of your capital to have it. And prepare for the worst when shit will hit the fan. Because if you value your life more than your property and your freedom, more than your life than you're practicum anarchist. And you, if you are hearing this, you are the resistance.

Thank you.
