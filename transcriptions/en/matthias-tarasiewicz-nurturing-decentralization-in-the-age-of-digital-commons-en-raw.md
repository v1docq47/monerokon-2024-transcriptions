_**Nurturing Decentralization in the Age of Digital Commons**_

_Decentralization has been a pivotal term behind significant technological shifts, yet its essence and potential have often been obscured by its transformation into a buzzword. Satoshi Nakamoto's vision with Bitcoin—to bypass traditional intermediaries—highlighted a path toward decentralization but did not fully avoid the emergence of new middlemen, underscoring the need for continuous engagement with decentralization's principles._

_This presentation examines decentralization as a driver for participatory technology across networked commons, including hardware, web3, and geopolitics. It underscores the promise of fostering equitable and sustainable collaborations, juxtaposed against considerable challenges. The principle that "convenience always beats security" reflects a central tension in our digital era, emphasizing that true decentralization requires vigilant effort and adaptability._

_Monero exemplifies a decentralized community closely aligned with Nakamoto's initial vision, prioritizing privacy and security to address Bitcoin's shortcomings. This highlights the potential of decentralized models to faithfully implement foundational ideals._

_Furthermore, the digital tragedy of the commons, as illustrated by OpenAI's mission to democratize AI, reveals the difficulty of aligning collective benefits with individual incentives within decentralized frameworks. This situation stresses the complexity of managing shared resources in harmony with decentralization's ethos._

_The path toward effective decentralization is fraught with intricacies, advocating for a culture of continuous inquiry. As technology evolves, we stand at a critical juncture, tasked with reevaluating and reshaping control and collaboration mechanisms. Decentralization is not merely a process but a persistent challenge to conventional norms, aiming to create a digital ecosystem that upholds security, sovereignty, and the common good, even when convenience temporarily prevails. This journey demands optimism and scrutiny, reminding us that our digital future should reflect our highest values of equity, participation, and transparency._

_**Matthias:**_ Thanks for showing up to my talk. It's fantastic to see you all here. I'm really happy to be at MoneroKon again. You can download the slides because I put a lot of links and things into the research, into the slides, so I made them available for you to download. So if you want to follow the things later on, so everything is validated. And this will make a lot of sense when you will see what I'm pointing to in my talk. So it has a bit of a random title, but you will understand in a few minutes why it's important to nurture decentralization, and why we have to nurture decentralization in the age of the digital commons.

So I want to quickly start before I jump into the talk to introduce myself. My name is Matthias Tarasiewicz. I'm working in open source and in technology since quite some time now. I'm also one of the founders of the RIAT Institute. We essentially work, it's an NGO, we work with open source and free software and with all things open and free, and we publish and research and we foster also supporting people and projects for quite some time. So the whole institution is existing for already, if we count before it was called RIAT, almost 20 years, which is quite some time in my opinion.

We have a lot of publications also. We especially made a few of those available for you. So essentially if you go to riat.at/publication_pack, we made available all the publications we did so far, which is a lot of books and things as well. And my colleagues have also brought some of the print material with them, so if you want to have them just approach us after the talk then we can very happily gift you some of our books that we brought with us. We are also part of the Decentral Community, which is an institutional, I would say a meta organization existing since a few years. We are always in the context of the Chaos Communication Congress, which is an annual hacker congress, hacker meeting in Germany, it's a very large one. We're jrganizing together with the Monero community what we call the Critical Decentralization Cluster. It's a cluster of different like-minded projects and people mostly in the domain of privacy and open source, and we producing program. If you want to see what we are doing, you can follow our work on decentral.community or you can also join us on Matrix or also watch the talks from the past years - it's most of it is online.

But to get into the to the weeds and to actual talk here, I structured this into four parts and I wanna be talking about decay of technological projects and platforms, and also I wanna thematize how open source shows some kind of decay, over time with decay, I mean it's actually transforming to something else. I'm not entirely sure if we know what it is yet, but it's definitely not the same open culture that we've seen a few years ago. And I want to be making a case for verifiable things, verifiable hardware, verifiable software, everything, all things verifiable, because I think that's what we as cypherpunks need to be looking for. Everything that's not verifiable is not trustworthy, so why to bother with it? And as a conclusion, I want to also point out a few things, a few suggestions actually, what I think we can use to nurture decentralization further.

So to jump into the part one of that. I want to be talking about this quote from Cory Doctorow. Maybe some of you know the term "enshittification", which was all over the web. It's like a heavily debated and heavily used term these days. And enshittification essentially tells a story and shows and explains to us how digital systems decay over time. Cory Doctorow is actually pointing it down to this kind of cycle of enshittification, how he calls it, which is actually four phases in which projects, products, any sort of system gets actually slowly worse and exploits the users. He's pointing this out with all sorts of systems we have these days on the example of YouTube, Twitch, all sorts of systems you can think of.

I'm thinking that we can actually maybe extend this to other cultures and to other things as well, because I feel like there's this decay that we can observe. And I want to make the point that this enshittification, and if you Google that, it's like a complete insanity going on. So a lot of people discussing it. It's really an online term that you should be aware of. Because I feel like it's interesting to me - I feel like I've heard that before - there's definitely different examples from the past, from history, where we see other ways of how to explain to me and to explain to us how things decay over time, especially technological systems, innovation, and so on.

So one of those examples has been already outlined by Jonathan Zittrain in his book "Future of the Internet and How to Stop It". It's a great book. If you don't know it, read it. It's freely available. Zittrain is making the point that we are getting used to all sorts of changes in systems, in technology around us. And it usually gets introduced very slowly with small tethers, so combinations to other systems and other perks that then tether you to an entire ecosystem. He's making the point on the case of the Apple App Store, and he's also making a specific point, and bear in mind this is from 2008. So he explains that, for example, Apple created the iPhone as the first phone at this time where you could not, users could not replace the battery anymore. And we got so used to it, and now we're not even questioning why we can't change the battery anymore. But this slow decay of things and of small things, small technologies is everywhere. And this is one example where we find this as well.

Another example is also some seminal text by Anderson and Wolf in Wired Magazine, where they were making the case that the web is like over. This was actually 2010, and they're making the case for the Internet. So what we see here very nicely is like there's this change of the protocols in use and we see how different media is suddenly used. So there's, as you see on the graph, also a lot more media used. Text becomes like, it's like changing, it's getting commodified. The whole web is changing. And so there's all this kind of different pointers where we see how things got "enshittified" already in different parts, different theories of the past century.

But also there's a lot of critique on the term "enshittification", on how Cory Doctorow sees this. There is even a text about the "enshittification of enshittification". Like everything that goes to shit is the TLDR here. But there's a few very nice approaches as well and a few really profound critique points which I don't wanna dive into now, but you can definitely take a look at - it's really worth it.

I think we can look at other systems as well and think of if they are facing some kind of enshittification. So they are changing, they are not doing what they're supposed to do with a little bit becoming something else. And for me, I was asking myself the question like: is Bitcoin maybe enshittifiying, is it enshittified, what's happening with Bitcoin? Looking at the original white paper of Satoshi and looking at Bitcoin now we see that this is a very different thing now in my opinion. Like at the time of Bitcoin we had a big problem which still doesn't seem to be solved to me, which is micropayments. So I want to be able to pay for something online and not have an intermediary. This is actually not solved by Bitcoin. It's solved by Monero. So why is this actually something that Bitcoin is supposed to solve? So I see like, and I want to make the point here that it's maybe not really enshittified yet, but it's definitely changing. So Bitcoin is not the same as what it was intended to be in the beginning. And we see this also with the example of the micropayments, but maybe on some other ends as well.

Some people might even go so far as to say that Bitcoin is really not that great and might provide "all of the tools to fuck you". I think that's to some extent true, but also I want to point here, also ArticMine was making the good point yesterday, that maybe we're just using this wrong. Maybe we should keep our public keys also private and not hand them out everywhere, then maybe it wouldn't be such a privacy nightmare. So I think that's definitely true, and while I think we should think about what a specific technology offers to us, that in the end, maybe it's a fundamental thing that is part of the technology itself that it has to change. Maybe something cannot stay the same or cannot stay the same as it was postulated at the beginning.

Looking at different examples of history, we see also that this has been thematized over and over. So the whole term "enshittification" and the whole decay of technology is nothing really super new. So here, most famously, Joseph Schumpeter was actually explaining how in the innovation cycle systems have to have this kind of honeymoon phase in the beginning. And there is actually a new system that creates always this kind of challenging factor, but eventually they have to also move away from their original goes and values as soon as they reach this position. And this is actually also available in a lot of other theories. So another example where we could argue that Bitcoin is enshittified already is the "Iron Law of Oligarchy", which comes from sociology and is pointing out that any system, however democratic it might start in the beginning, tends to become an oligarchy over time. So on the case of Bitcoin we can actually talk about decentralization and centralization and observe how specific centralization factors are appearing in Bitcoin.

Another good example from a more recent time is the institutional isomorphism, which essentially says that all institutions over time somehow behave the same, appear the same. So that's also interesting to me. So that introduces the problem that over time we have to think about like what kind of time factor we're looking at here, and how are these systems, how are these different technological systems even distinguishable from each other. So I think this is good point because we can actually also observe this with a lot of different shitcoins out there. They tend to solve the same problems, or at least they're claiming to solve the same problems. So I think this is not maybe a cryptocurrency only thing here, but this is a here from a systemic view definitely an organizational form that tends to be the same over time.

Somehow relating this to theory, we can also think about how to escape this enshittification, how to get out of this vicious cycle, how can this actually change? And maybe this is well known, this publication, not sure if you're aware, if not, read it. It's a very good book that is often cited. It's called "Exit, Voice and Loyalty" from Albert Hirschmann. Hirschmann was presenting essentially, if you're not aware about the theory, in the 70s on what are the fundamental principles of decision that a user has or a customer has towards a service or product. So they can either exit, not criticizing anything, just stop using it or they can voice, so they can try to change it, they can voice the concern, they can try to somehow change the product, or they don't care because they are, they have, for example, skin in the game, or they don't wanna deal with it, they can stay loyal but not do anything, so it's like the non-participation route. I think that's interesting, and I think with this framework, we can actually observe a lot of the systems out there, and we can also maybe draw conclusions to Monero. I think these are like, this is very good framework also to understand how we can conquer enshittification, how we can actually make sure and observe if a system is enshittified and how we can potentially, what kind of options we have if we can identify enshittification.

The question remains if we can actually change something. So often in centralized systems, in specific systems that are out there, maybe in Bitcoin, maybe we are not in the position to change something because maybe we are not in the core team, maybe we are not in a specific team that can decide something. The problem is always like also then a question of influence and a question of who you know. So it becomes maybe this kind of oligarchic problem that I discussed before. So while we can maybe conclude that enshittification is a thing that happens to all systems, especially if money is involved, fully decentralized systems are not that easy and enshittifiable, if that's a word. And I think Monero is a good example because I think it's like pretty tough to enshittify Monero fully, because it's like very decentralized. There's a lot of stakeholders there. And definitely it's also not purely financial gains at the core of it. That's maybe I'm not sure if that's true, but let's hope.

So this type of degradation might be a thing that hopefully changes things for the better, but I think, and I hope I explained to you the core principles of enshittification, because you need this kind of piece of information to take it to the second step of my presentation, which is I'm trying to argue why open source is enshittified. And maybe, and I hope you're still following the enshittification thing. It's for me also, I'm not a native speaker, I'd be tough to say enshittification, enshittification, enshittification. Should have tested this better.

So I wanna argue that open source is enshittified. It is because I'm researching this for quite some time. So I looked at a lot of licenses, I was running a few smaller open source projects, I was helping out. So I'm like very active in the culture. And to me personally, it feels like a lot is changing. It feels like not the same anymore. People are stopping to care. Open sources feels not so strong anymore. I thought like: okay, maybe this is just an age thing, I don't know. So I was talking to a lot of people that I know and I was trying to figure out if this is really just me observing this. But felt like a bit of a… the sentiment has changed in open source.

And I wanna actually to make my point of why I think open source is enshittified, make a distinction between open source and public source. So there is definitely something which is open source minus the community, which is called "public source", at least suggested by a researcher that there should be a distinction done like that. I'm not if that's an official classification, but public source is open source minus the community.

And if you think about it, there's a lot of repos, a lot of products out there that are really doing that. So you cannot really participate. It's kind of theoretically open source. You're supposed to be able to do something, but you can't. A very good example is the Android operating system. You could maybe upstream something, maybe, if you know someone. But do you know anyone who ever could upstream something there? Another good example is everything that's under the Apple public source license. I think these projects are really dead. They are like enshittified. But if you want a stamp of enshittification, I think that's the Apple public source license. It's really bad. You can do your own research if you don't believe me, but it's really a joke.

So I want to make the case for why open source is enshittified by taking this quote from a venture capitalist who was saying, most famously in 2011, I believe: "software is eating the world". And while software is eating the world, it doesn't really look like people that are writing those software pieces and maintaining this software are having such a good time.

I'm not sure if you know this joke. This is an XKCD joke about a person thankless maintaining a software project in Nebraska. It became like the meme, like the person in Nebraska - it can be somewhere else, it could be anywhere in the world, but in this case, Nebraska was picked. And it's actually the joke, everyone knows the joke. I don't find it so funny, although I was laughing in beginning, but if you think more about it, it's like a lot of people thanklessly support open source, maintain open source. And I think the case for open source being enshittified is even made stronger if you think about what's happening to open source as a culture. Because in a way, most of the people see open source as everything that's on GitHub. And that's a bit of a limiting way of how to see the whole open source scene. But this is how it's seen by a lot of people, especially people who are not that deep in open source.

And the problem is that this thanklessly maintained software out of Nebraska and anywhere else in the world actually faces a lot of problems because we've seen this just recently. There was a huge exploit in a compression software that was luckily found in the last minute. So there was a really, really long attack. Like over a few years, people got access to the XZ compression software. And this could only be pulled off because there was, the people were really burned out. The people wanted to pass on a few tasks of the system, but it was really, it was really not smart what they did. There were a few choices that were maybe, could have been managed better, but then at the same time, it's like two people that were managing this. So it's like really astonishing to me how much of our critical infrastructure of the world is running, being maintained by a few people. So if you look at OpenSSH, a few of the cryptographic tools of the world are run by a few people that are maybe not earning enough, then being burned out. This is not smart. We have to really do something about this. And I think this is only one side of the coin of why open source is enshittified. So it's not about only the maintenance of the software, but I think there's also structural change that we see.

So I found this really nice debate and discussion also from Murphy, a young researcher that is pointing out that we have also an incentive problem generally in developing software. So young people, young developers, would not very likely start to develop in open source because there's a lot of other incentives that you have. For example, writing and deploying software on Google Play Store, on Apple App Store, or so you can much quicker make a living out of that. And that's actually as a narrative much stronger than thanklessly maintaining software from the best. So I think we can do a lot in that by changing also our narratives about that, about thinking how we can support open source better. Because the problem I think is if we don't think about this as a community, as a culture, Microsoft will. Because there's already on GitHub this kind of donation program. And this is all bad. This is tethering the developers to one organization. It's not good. It's like giving too much control to a single entity.

So there's this other response to the term that software is eating the world, which is open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world. I was actually not sure if that's true, but I checked it and it's actually shocking how much open source software we have already. I mean, I'm a big open source enthusiast, but I think there is something we have to also look at here, which is like there's a lot of different software licenses in place and a lot, all of them are like really great for us as a society.

I wanna here not go into extreme detail about the different licenses. I think John Murphy was giving a very great talk yesterday also about understanding the different licensing models and how Monero does fit into that. you should really watch that. That was really great. So I'm not going into these details. There's a few other people that are writing a lot about that topic as well. So I can recommend Dev Lawyer, who has a great blog, and explaining really in detail on how the different licenses are affecting specific implementations and actually relevant for you as a developer or as a user.

But if we look at open source and we try to understand what is out there, what is used, what is the open source culture as a whole, the interesting thing is that it's mostly permissive licenses. And so if you look at data - I mean there's a lot of data sources you can actually take, so there's a lot of data from different archives, there's not only GitHub, there's also But this is the data from GitHub, for example, so you see also that the top license is MIT. You have a lot of other, Apache 2 and then GPL 3. And this is also changing over the years. It's not very visible here, but you can maybe later look this up on the slide.

The problem is also, looking at GitHub alone shows us that there's a lot of stuff that is not having a license or has the default checkbox. And this is also relevant because GitHub changed the default checkbox value a few years ago. So who knows if people really care about what they're clicking here. So I'm not sure if we can actually use the GitHub sources as an interesting data source.

There's still a lot of other interesting sources we can take a look at. For example, here this is actually the software conservancy. So there's like a lot of other places which always like show that the main licenses used are mainly MIT and mainly permissive licenses. So the copyleft licenses are in the minority everywhere.

And I think I will actually extend all the discussed kind of citations before and sentences to "permissive open source licenses are eating the commons faster than software is eating the world". Because we have actually open source culture and the whole open source culture being a permissive license culture, which doesn't sound bad, but I argue that from a cypherpunk perspective, we want more open licenses because we wanna validate things. We wanna actually validate the software we're running. We wanna ideally validate the hardware we're running, because otherwise, how can you trust this? You introduce trust through permissive licenses because people can actually close down the code again, release this. You cannot verify it in the worst case. I'm not saying this is always the case, but in the worst case, you cannot verify that so introducing trust into the whole system. So we want those open source systems, though, because we want to be able to verify them.

So also Monero is under permissive license. I don't think that this is a big problem from licensing apart from Monero, but we've seen what kind of issues this introduces. I mean, I'm not saying that I'm a big fan of these forks, I guess nobody is, but there is like all these kind of forks coming up. There is definitely more to Monero than just the code. It's definitely the network. It's the community. But it was also discussed several times from different angles. What about the licensing debate - it's a huge discussion also on the different CCS project on what kind of license should be used. I'm not saying that I'm unhappy with what Monero does at the moment. I'm just saying think about it, read what those licenses do and what you're able to do with them, because they matter and they are like really important to understand what you're doing with your software, and what you are able to do with your software.

So as I said before, I want to actually make the case that we should be able to verify everything, because I feel like in the context of cypherpunk, in the context of Monero, we should try and verify more than we would usually because we want to be able to also have a high level of privacy, high level of anonymity, and we want to be able to have verifiable systems not only to understand them, but also to have a high security aspect.

So in this context, I only gave a talk on exactly this stage a few years ago. If you wanna look at this, then I would be happy. So this one was about open and libre hardware and how we can actually create very flexible hardware. I just wanna quickly talk about a few things in this context of this talk. So if we talk about free, open, public, libre things, usually a very easy way to categorize them would be to circuit as like: there's software, there's content, there's data, there's hardware. The problem is with hardware. This was what I outlined in the talk that I linked It's an entirely different beast, because we will not be able to verify hardware so easily.

The problem essentially is that most systems if we're talking we're just taking the software and just taking the hardware part are black boxes, we cannot really test them. There's no way for us to verify them. There is maybe specific workarounds in that, but especially in hardware, we have a really, really hard time in doing that.

Another point I wanna actually make is that it's not enough to just look at, what's open? Just open sounds good, and so I'm keeping this because I can verify it. It's actually a very, very commodified term, and we have been writing a whole book about this. The problem is - take Open AI. What is open about this? It doesn't make any sense to me. So like the whole term open and a lot of all the other terms already got enshittified. So we have to be aware that we cannot use any of these terminologies, we cannot use this, cannot even rely on anything like that. So even open standards, if we don't verify means nothing. So don't just look at what these things are, try to verify them, try to disassemble them.

And this is also a point that Bunnie Huang is making. So it's a really fantastic talk he has been giving at 36C3, which was called "Open Source Is Insufficient to Solve Trust Problems in Hardware". So what his point essentially is, maybe you know Bunnie, he was actually reverse engineering and hacking the Xbox and so on. He's a very famous hardware hacker. And he's making everything that he does available. So he created also an open source notebook, lots of things. The thing is like this guy is really very, very knowledgeable and is working over 10 years already on different approaches on how to verify hardware. It's just not possible, because microcomputers, microchips, microcontrollers, hardware in general is so tiny and is really not possible to really be made verifiable.

There is also a few elements which could already be implemented into hardware, and you would not be even able to detect them. Such as stealthy dopant-level, hardware Trojan - there is a paper from 2013 which is thematizing this. Although nobody has spotted this, because it's really hard to spot, the theory is really solid. And there's also examples of how this could actually easily bit flip or so on. So what Bunnie came up with as a solution is he creates custom hardware that is obfuscated so you cannot do geographic attacks on the actual hardware. But that you can only do if you design the hardware yourself and if you're able to use this hardware yourself, which is actually tough if you want to use standard encryption or fast encryption, anything that's recent.

So essentially, for those people who are really, really interested in making sure that they are using verifiable systems, they are stuck with old hardware. They stuck with systems that can reverse engineer, systems where they can maybe excess and change the boot loaders, the firmware and so on. It's a pretty tough thing. So I think like all of these things are getting enshittified. So hardware got enshittified, software got enshittified. Essentially, cypherpunk culture got enshittified. Everything seems to be going to shit. But I think there's still a way for us how to verify those things. So we have to at least try.

It's tough with modern hardware, but I think a bigger problem at the moment are mobile phones, for example. So I want to point to the Replicant project, in my opinion does a really fantastic job also in explaining the problem. So we have with phones, the problem that a lot of the modems are not really usable from a libre perspective, because they are containing binary blobs. So you have to trust the providers of those drivers that they are not doing any shenanigans or not falling home. So that's a big limitation. So it's such a tiny fraction of hardware we're really able to use to verifiably and provably do some cryptographic shenanigans we want to do as cypherpunks. And that's sad.

I think we should try and really unshittify this kind of situation, if that's a word. So Bunnie's approach is to create things that can be visually inspected. But I don't think that that's really a feasible track that we can do as cypherpunks, because a lot of things are too tiny. So microcomputers are by definition micro and so we cannot really use the inspection. Although he has a few examples of how we could do that. I would say the problem is we have to thematize this and think about this hard, because also free and available technologies such as RISC-V are not solving the situation. So there's a huge proprietary portion in the whole RISC-V manufactured chips as well that people are not talking about. While the instruction set is open, the chips themselves are not open. So there's a lot of things and everything seems to be getting enshittified.

So I think we have to, if we cycle back to Monero, also think about what can we do in this kind of enshittified situation? Can we maybe do some kind of decentralized verification? Can we do something that utilizes this great community we have? Can we do something that helps in actually making this possible without having to inspect all the hardware we have and without like observing the supply chain and everything? And I think that definitely is a few ways of how we can do that.

And this is my conclusion. So I think, I hope I could actually show you that platforms and products decay over time. I'm sure there are like more examples like that and there is more you can read online about how things getting enshittified.

But I think the problem that we are facing in this is more, as we are also shaping the technology around us, that we have to start re-investigating the technologies we're looking at. So we have to constantly re-validate them and understand and check: okay, is this still what we wanted, is this still what we signed up for? On the example of Bitcoin, on the example of Monero, on the example of all the technologies around us, so that this kind of slow decay cannot happen.

And I think I hopefully made the point good that open sources enshittified as well. We cannot use the term "open" to signify anything, because it's a completely shit term that is just a marketing speak and doesn't mean anything these days. So we should aim for verifiable things. So we should try to verify things. We should be able to reproduce, verify and make sure that we are using verifiable computing, verifiable devices, all sorts of things verifiable. And I think the only way of how we can do that is by gaining more technological literacy. So the products around us, technologies around us are trying to abstract a lot of layers away from us, such as hardware, such as the hard parts, the cryptographic parts. I think that's important to not do that and really look at the things that we can actually learn, try to understand most of it and try to ask, this is something we can do as a community and I'm really happy that Monero is doing exactly that. So that means we have to think about the device drivers, you have to think about binary blobs, you have to think about hardware and the freedom of hardware, but you also have to think about what and how these things come to be. It's like usually it's not impossible to understand these things, but we have to also stop using these proprietary devices, stop using these devices that are not following our standards.

And another very simple example, and I love this example, and I love this about the Monero community, as I was also actively taking part at this was the MoneroKon, I'm not sure if you remember this or two years ago, this was a decentralized action of the Monero community to validate and to verify what centralized exchanges do with their Monero reserves. And if you remember, so a lot of people, so the theory behind it is you wanna move your Monero anyway off your centralized exchanges because that's what's the reasonable choice. But then, what is also interesting is that most of the, or the theory at least said, most of the centralized exchanges don't hold even the right amount of Monero on their books. They don't have to show it so they don't care. So they will exchange only if you move stuff off of the exchanges. And interestingly on the same day when this was happening and when the Decentralize Monero was happening, a lot of the of the exchanges were facing issues with their wallets. So that was really interesting and created a decentralized way of how, a ranked list of the best exchanges, centralized exchanges that are using Monero. So these kind of things, these kind of community action, decentralized action is something we can do as a community very easily. It gets harder, of course, with hardware. gets a bit harder with specific implementations of software, but this is definitely something we should go for, decentralized verification community action.

Yeah, so this is my last slide. And I hope I could explain you the context of commons and how we want to have validatable things. And I want to leave you with this quote from the Decentral community from 2019, is that "Decentralization is a process and has to be constantly challenged". Thank you very much.
